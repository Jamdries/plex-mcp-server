# Plex MCP Server

A powerful Model-Controller-Protocol server for interacting with Plex Media Server, providing a standardized JSON-based interface for automation, scripting, and integration with other tools.

## Overview

Plex MCP Server creates a unified API layer on top of the Plex Media Server API, offering:

- **Standardized JSON responses** for compatibility with automation tools, AI systems, and other integrations
- **Multiple transport methods** (stdio and SSE) for flexible integration options
- **Rich command set** for managing libraries, collections, playlists, media, users, and more
- **Error handling** with consistent response formats
- **Easy integration** with automation platforms (like n8n) and custom scripts

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Plex Media Server with valid authentication token
- Access to the Plex server (locally or remotely)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example`:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Add your Plex server URL and token to the `.env` file:
   ```
   PLEX_URL=http://your-plex-server:32400
   PLEX_TOKEN=your-plex-token
   ```

## Usage

The server can be run in two transport modes: stdio (Standard Input/Output) or SSE (Server-Sent Events). Each mode is suitable for different integration scenarios.

### Running with stdio Transport

The stdio transport is ideal for direct integration with applications like Claude Desktop or Cursor. It accepts commands via standard input and outputs results to standard output in JSON format.

Basic command line usage:
```bash
python3 -m plex_mcp
```
or
```bash
python3 plex_mcp_server.py --transport stdio
```

#### Configuration Example for Claude Desktop/Cursor
Add this configuration to your application's settings:
```json
{
  "plex": {
    "command": "python",
    "args": [
      "C://Users//User//Documents//plex-mcp-server//plex_mcp_server.py",
      "--transport=stdio"
    ],
    "env": {
      "PLEX_URL":"http://localhost:32400",
      "PLEX_TOKEN":"av3khi56h634v3",
      "PLEX_USERNAME:"Administrator"
    }
  }
}
```

### Running with SSE Transport

The Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport provides a web-based interface for integration with web applications and services.

Start the server:
```bash
python3 plex_mcp_server.py --transport sse --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3001
```

Default options:
- Host: 0.0.0.0 (accessible from any network interface)
- Port: 3001
- SSE endpoint: `/sse`
- Message endpoint: `/messages/`

#### Configuration Example for SSE Client
When the server is running in SSE mode, configure your client to connect using:
```json
{
  "plex": {
    "url": "http://localhost:3001/sse"
  }
}
```

With SSE, you can connect to the server via web applications or tools that support SSE connections.

## Read-Only Mode üîí

**By default, the server runs in read-only mode** to protect your Plex server from unintended modifications. This is especially useful when:
- Testing the server for the first time
- Integrating with AI agents or untrusted applications
- Providing safe access to Plex information without modification risks
- Running in production environments where changes should be controlled

### How It Works

When read-only mode is enabled, all write operations are blocked:
- ‚ùå Library scans and refreshes
- ‚ùå Media editing and deletion
- ‚ùå Playlist/collection creation and modification  
- ‚ùå Playback control
- ‚ùå Server maintenance tasks
- ‚úÖ All read operations (searching, listing, viewing) remain available

If a write operation is attempted, you'll receive an error:
```json
{
  "error": "Operation 'media_delete' is not allowed in read-only mode. Set READ_ONLY_MODE=false in your environment to enable write operations."
}
```

### Enabling Write Operations

To allow modifications to your Plex server, set the `READ_ONLY_MODE` environment variable to `false`:

**Option 1: Environment Variable**
```bash
export READ_ONLY_MODE=false
python3 plex_mcp_server.py
```

**Option 2: .env File**
Add to your `.env` file:
```
READ_ONLY_MODE=false
```

**Option 3: Docker Compose**
In your `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
environment:
  - READ_ONLY_MODE=false
```

**Option 4: Docker Run**
```bash
docker run -e READ_ONLY_MODE=false plex-mcp-server
```

### Security Recommendations

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only disable read-only mode when necessary
- üîê Keep it enabled for AI agents and automated systems
- üìù Use read-only mode for monitoring and reporting tools
- üéØ Disable only for trusted administrative tools

## Response Format

All commands return standardized JSON responses for maximum compatibility with various tools, automation platforms, and AI systems. This consistent structure makes it easy to process responses programmatically.

For successful operations, the response typically includes:
```json
{
  "success_field": true,
  "relevant_data": "value",
  "additional_info": {}
}
```

For errors, the response format is:
```json
{
  "error": "Error message describing what went wrong"
}
```

For multiple matches (when searching by title), results are returned as an array of objects with identifying information:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Item Title",
    "id": 12345,
    "type": "movie",
    "year": 2023
  },
  {
    "title": "Another Item",
    "id": 67890,
    "type": "show",
    "year": 2022
  }
]
```

## Debugging

For development and debugging, you can use the included `watcher.py` script which monitors for changes and automatically restarts the server.
